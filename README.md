# 🎓 Blockchain Voting System

A secure, transparent, and decentralized voting platform built using **Django** and **Solidity**, integrated with the **Polygon Mainnet** via **Alchemy RPC**. It ensures tamper-proof voting processes for academic elections with a powerful admin backend.

## 🔐 Core Features

- 🗳 Vote casting with receipt hash stored on the blockchain.
- 🔄 Admin panel sync of candidates and positions to smart contract.
- ✅ Sync status indicators (`✔ Synced` / `✖ Not Synced`) with timestamps.
- 🚫 Restriction of edits/deletions after sync for data integrity.
- 🧾 Vote logs are view-only in the Django admin.

## 💡 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4+, Django Rest Framework
- **Blockchain**: Solidity Smart Contracts on Polygon
- **Web3**: Web3.py with Alchemy RPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Frontend**: Django Admin (for management)

## 📦 Folder Structure (Important Modules)

├── utils.py # Transaction builder, signer, and Web3 setup
├── helpers.py # Sync and voting helper methods
├── abi.json # Smart contract ABI
elections/
├── models.py # Election, Position, Candidate models
├── admin.py # Blockchain sync actions
├── serializers.py # DRF serializers

├── models.py # Vote storage and metadata
├── admin.py # View-only admin of cast votes



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Admin creates elections, positions, and candidates**.
2. Positions and Candidates are synced to the blockchain using **admin actions**.
3. Users vote through the API — each vote triggers a smart contract method call.
4. A hashed receipt of the voter's DID is sent on-chain for transparency.
5. Votes are stored off-chain in Django for analytics and speed.

## 🔁 Syncing to Blockchain

Syncing is done via Django Admin using actions:
- ✅ `Sync to Blockchain` for positions or candidates
- Status is tracked using `is_synced` and `last_synced_at`

Once synced:
- Record becomes **read-only**
- Cannot be deleted from admin

## 🔐 Security Design

- Level 400 students are automatically **disqualified** from voting or contesting.
- Only eligible users (by department/level) can vote for specific positions.
- Blockchain guarantees **immutability** of votes.

## 🌐 Smart Contract Info

- **Network**: Polygon Mainnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x754a018CEC340067896b50130C782AE4fe85B174`
- **Compiler**: Solidity `0.8.30`

## 🚀 Deployment

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Set Alchemy URL, contract address, wallet keys
```


### 2. Run the Server

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```


### 3. Admin Access

- Login to /admin and use sync buttons for blockchain actions.
